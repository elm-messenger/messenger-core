Notes:

-   UI.elm was excluded since it only contains messenger-generated functions.
-   /UI was excluded since it will not be exposed to user.
-   Scene/loader was excluded since it only contains messenger-generated functions.
-   /Resource/Base was excluded since it is only used internally.
-   All portable-related and global-component-related functions was excluded since I am not familiar with them. They are commonly seen in Scene/Scene and Component/GlobalComponent.
-   MMSg need more docs.
-   Recursionand Model excluded since they are used only internally.
-   Generally All files under Scene has relatively poor doc since they are too basic so that I am not very confident about them. Please take care of them.
-   Note that I added some grammar sugar(MiddleSteps) in Layer.Layer and Component.Component. Please test all of them except UpdateMiddleStep(it has proved to be useful in our P2).
-   UserConfig.elm excluded since it has been automatically handled in resource.elm. I am considering to add an example at the doc introduction
-   Enjoy your day!
