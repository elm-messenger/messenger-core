  - Note: To add a font in a messenger game, follow these steps:

1.  copy the font package (\*.ttf) into assets/misc folder
2.  edit public/style.css, adding these lines:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'YourFontName';
  src: url(../assets/misc/your-font-file-name.ttf);
}
```

          - variant has only one option: "normal" or "small-caps", which will display all lowercase letters in smaller uppercase letters.
